# boomshine
I created a game called Boomshine in Javacript. How it works is that you must start the game by pressing shift and there will be balls floating around the screen. The objective is to click one to make as many balls expand as possible. I created multiple levels for the game as well, which are very difficult if you choose to try playing.
